<h2 id="intro">Description</h2>
<p>As part of our curriculum, we were tasked with a two-week sprint where we had to implement certain functionality within the Vertigo Theatre . This was done with other students as my teammates and instructors as project managers. Working according to the Agile methodology and within the scrum framework, I completed multiple stories where I created a smooth and navigable UI while defining a UX.</p>

<p><strong>My website allowed for:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>creation of a mountain-bike (MTB) trail review,</li>
  <li>updating or deleting that MTB trail review,</li>
  <li>viewing data from a top-ten MTB list scraped from another website, and</li>
  <li>viewing data from an API that provided MTB trails in central Colorado.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Technologies used by me were:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Django</li>
  <li>Azure DevOps</li>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>REST API</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="bs">Scraping Data via BeautifulSoup</h2>
<p>One story required the use of the Python package BeautifulSoup to scrape data from an existing webpage. Check out the code and screenshot.</p>

```
## Beautiful Soup webpage scraping.
## View for scraping our selected page.
def top_mtb(request):
    # Empty list for use in for loop.
    top_bikes = []
    
    # Empty list for use in for loop.
    bike_desc = []
    
    # Empty list for use in last for loop. This loop concatenates the other two lists.
    full_bike_desc = []
    
    # URL to be scraped.
    page = requests.get('https://www.outdoorgearlab.com/topics/biking/best-mountain-bike')
    
    # Setting soup object using the particular html parser.
    soup = BeautifulSoup(page.content, 'html.parser')
    
    # Accessing second 'articletext' class as there are two used (and we want the second only).
    parent = soup.find_all('div', class_='articletext')[1:]
    
    # This for loop iterates through the 'h2' tags within the class 'articletext'.
    # They are put into the blank 'bike_desc' list.
    for i in parent:
        desc = i.find_all('h2')
        for j in desc:
            desc_txt = j.text
            bike_desc.append(desc_txt)

    # This second body of the for loop iterates through the 'h3' tags within 'articletext'.
    # They are put into the blank 'top_bikes' list.
        bike = i.find_all('h3')
        for x in bike:
            bike_txt = x.text
            top_bikes.append(bike_txt)
            
    # New list containing only the elements we want from both lists.
    new_desc_list = bike_desc[0:8]
    new_top_bike_list = top_bikes[0:8]

    # Joining together list elements since we have two separate lists above.
    z = 0
    for desc in new_desc_list:
        bike_model = new_desc_list[0 + z] + ': ' + new_top_bike_list[0 + z]
        full_bike_desc.append(bike_model)
        z += 1

    context = {'full_bike_desc': full_bike_desc}
    return render(request, 'MTB_Trails/top_mtb.html', context)
```

<h2 id="api">Sourcing Data via an API</h2>
<p>Another story had me locating an API that would be suitable for my particular use and implementing it as a source of data. I brought in all data provided and then selected only certain parameters (name of trail, description, difficulty [if specified]) that I wanted to pass to my webpage. Check out the code and video.</p>

```
def trail_api(request):
    # API code from https://rapidapi.com/trailapi/api/trailapi/
    url = "https://trailapi-trailapi.p.rapidapi.com/trails/explore/"

    # Latitude and longitude required. 'per_page' and 'radius' optional.
    parameters = {"lat": "39", "lon": "-106", "per_page": "300", "radius": "100"}
    headers = {
        "X-RapidAPI-Host": "trailapi-trailapi.p.rapidapi.com",
        "X-RapidAPI-Key": "e3b28ce81fmshbcd98af11e9812dp1487c5jsnaf6f45c8d994"
    }
    response = requests.request("GET", url, headers=headers, params=parameters)
    json_response = response.json()

    # Empty lists to populate with data we want to pull from the API.
    trail_name_list = []
    trail_desc_list = []
    trail_city_list = []
    trail_difficulty_list = []

    # Populating all lists except 'trail_list'.
    for item in json_response['data']:
        trail_name_list.append(item['name'])
        trail_desc_list.append(item['description'])
        trail_city_list.append(item['city'])
        trail_difficulty_list.append(item['difficulty'])

    trail_list = zip(trail_name_list, trail_desc_list, trail_city_list, trail_difficulty_list)

    context = {'trail_list': trail_list}
    return render(request, 'MTB_Trails/trail_api.html', context)
```

<h2 id="ux">Video Showcasing UI and UX</h2>
<p>I was quite pleased to see how the website came together: the melded colors, the slick and straightforward interface. Please enjoy a quick video of the functionality and pages created within the Django framework.</p>
